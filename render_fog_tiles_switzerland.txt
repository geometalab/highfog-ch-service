How to render white Tiles that simulate a flooded Switzerlad using a GeoTiff height model

1. Cut out switzerland + buffer from your GeoTiff
- Get the Swiss boundaries in the shapefile format here: https://github.com/interactivethings/swiss-maps/tree/master/src/swissBOUNDARIES3D/2015
- Open most the recent shapefile containing "LANDESGEBIET" in its filename in QGIS.
- Merge all Polygons by selecting all Polygons, enabling editing and clicking Merge selected features in the toolbar.
- Now add a bufer under Vector->Geoprocessing Tools->Buffer(s)...
- Select your shapefile as input, 1000 as buffer distance and a output file.
- Add the GeoTiff file to the QGIS project.
- Lastly clip the GeoTiff by opening Raster->Extraction->Clipper...
- Add an output file. Be shure to set "No data value" to 0. In clipping mode choose Mask layer and your buffered shapefile. Now Click OK to clip the GeoTiff.

2. Create map tiles
- To create the tiles you have to run the tiler.py script. Be shure to have MapTiler Pro and GDAL installed on your device and added to the PATH variable.
- Run tiler.py with following parameters:
tiler.py calc inputfile outputdirectory min_height max_height step min_zoom max_zoom
